          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>
    
          <h2>James 2:1-10</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">ESV (English Standard Version)</p>
          <p> 
            <sup>1</sup> My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. 
            <sup>2</sup> For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, 
            <sup>3</sup> and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,” 
            <sup>4</sup> have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? 
            <sup>5</sup> Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him? 
            <sup>6</sup> But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court? 
            <sup>7</sup> Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called? <br><br>
            <sup>8</sup> If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well. 
            <sup>9</sup> But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. 
            <sup>10</sup> For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.
           </p>

           


          <br><hr>
          <h2 class="chapterTitle">GUIDE REFLECTION:</h2> <br>

          <p><b><sup>8</sup> If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.</b> <br><br>
        
          In verses 1-7, James argues that showing favoritism to the rich over the poor is foolish for two reasons. <br><br>

          First, it's a sin because it ignores the fact that everyone is equal and overlooks our true destiny in the Kingdom of heaven. It also shows a lack of faith in God who provides for everyone. <br><br>
          
          Second, it's absurd to favor the rich when they are the ones oppressing the poor. <br><br>
          
          The rich in James's time didn't care about treating Christians fairly. <br><br>
          
          James says believers are doing the right thing when they genuinely follow the royal law. This law is called "royal" because Jesus, the King of Kings, endorsed it. This command should be the only guide for how we honor every person, no matter their status in the community.</p><br><br>

          <p><b><sup>9</sup> But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</b> <br><br>
        
        James states that showing favoritism to someone because of their wealth or power is a sin. When we do this, we break the command to love our neighbors as ourselves and become lawbreakers.<br><br>

        God deeply cares that each of us should not judge people by worldly standards. While James focuses on favoritism toward wealthy, powerful people, the same principle applies to discrimination based on race, gender, or other factors.</p><br><br>

        <p><b><sup>10</sup> For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.</b> <br><br>
        
        In the previous verse, James insisted that showing favoritism to a wealthy person over a poor one is a sin. It means failing to obey God's command to love others as we love ourselves, making us lawbreakers.<br><br>

        James reveals that even breaking <u>one command</u> in the Law makes us guilty as if we had broken <u>all of them</u>. The point isn't that all sins are equally bad, but in God's eyes, a sin is still a sin, and we are guilty of breaking God's Royal Law.<br><br>

        Humans have only two choices: either a person is perfect and can be saved, or they are not, which is the reality for everyone. If someone "stumbles," they are considered to have "failed" just as much as if they had deliberately disobeyed God's law their whole life.<br><br>

        Even if we can't keep just one of the Ten Commandments, we are still guilty, and every violation has consequences. This means humans are in a lost state because we can never meet God's standard of Holiness.<br><br>
        
        That's why we need a perfect, sinless sacrifice to wash away our sins, something we cannot do on our own. We need God's rescue.<br><br>
        
        This is why we are encouraged to study God's Word to learn about the solution He provided. God made a way to help people because it's impossible for humans to find the path to salvation on their own.<br><br>
        
        Since everyone is guilty, only God can save us. We are instructed to study God's Word to understand how we can achieve the solution He provided for humanity's lost condition. We are encouraged to set aside what we've learned from our religions and let God teach us through His words.<br><br>
        
        We need to keep studying God's Word. <br><br>
        
        Why? <br><br>
        
        A slight misunderstanding on God's solution, meaning what God has done for us, our soul is at stake. The outcome of that mistake will result to either, we live for eternity in Hell or with God, we must pay close attention to the state of our soul after life. Because there will be no second chance to repent once we reach God's judgment.<br><br>
        
        If you believe you've attained the salvation offered by God but continue on sinning or defying His will, it's important to engage in self-reflection. Does my religion teaches the accurate understanding of God's Word?  Or does my lifestyle and the way I understand God's truth is questionable? In either scenario, it is imperative to ensure that our understanding  aligns with the truths about God.<br><br>
        
        Remember, religion cannot save us, only God can. Though those who became instruments of that wrong teaching or religion will face God's judgment for leading people astray and away from Him. Everyone who has been an instrument in leading people away from God or causing confusion about the truths of God will also face judgment before God.<br><br>

        So, if you are going to teach anything about God, search your heart and make sure that only the complete truth of God's Word will come out of your mouth, because if you also become an instrument of confusion to people, you will also be accountable before God.<br><br>

        As the listener of those teachings, you are also responsible for what you hear. Remember, your own soul is still at stake here.<br><br>
        
        When was the last time you seriously studied God's Word? If you haven't done it yet, most of what you know about God might just be from what you've heard from people or religions that also use God's Word.<br><br>

        The Bible may seem like a simple book, but when you crack it open, you'll discover the immense truths and information it holds. Everything we need to understand about God and His plan for humanity is there, waiting for us to explore and study. Let God, through His Holy Spirit, be your guide so you can know all the truths in God's entire program.<br><br>
        
        We're encouraged to keep studying and reflecting on His Word until we find the freedom and salvation that God offers to everyone.</p>
