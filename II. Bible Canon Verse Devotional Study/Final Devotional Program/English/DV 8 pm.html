          <p class="chapterTitle">Bible Verse of the Day - Evening</p>

          <h2>Matthew 22:1-14</h2>
          <p class="chapterTitle">NLT (New Living Translation)</p>
          <p>   
            <sup>1</sup> Jesus also told them other parables. He said, 
            <sup>2</sup> “The Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of a king who prepared a great wedding feast for his son. 
            <sup>3</sup> When the banquet was ready, he sent his servants to notify those who were invited. But they all refused to come! 
            <sup>4</sup>  “So he sent other servants to tell them, ‘The feast has been prepared. The bulls and fattened cattle have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the banquet!’ 
            <sup>5</sup> But the guests he had invited ignored them and went their own way, one to his farm, another to his business. 
            <sup>6</sup> Others seized his messengers and insulted them and killed them. 
            <sup>7</sup>  “The king was furious, and he sent out his army to destroy the murderers and burn their town. 
            <sup>8</sup> And he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, and the guests I invited aren’t worthy of the honor. 
            <sup>9</sup> Now go out to the street corners and invite everyone you see.’ 
            <sup>10</sup> So the servants brought in everyone they could find, good and bad alike, and the banquet hall was filled with guests. 
            <sup>11</sup>  “But when the king came in to meet the guests, he noticed a man who wasn’t wearing the proper clothes for a wedding. 
            <sup>12</sup> ‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how is it that you are here without wedding clothes?’ But the man had no reply. 
            <sup>13</sup> Then the king said to his aides, ‘Bind his hands and feet and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ [14]  “For many are called, but few are chosen.”
