                <sup>14</sup>  “To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Origin of the creation of God, says this:

                <sup>18</sup> I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed; and eye salve to apply to your eyes so that you may see. 
                <sup>19</sup> Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.

                <p>    
                    <sup>1</sup> Jesus also told them other parables. He said, 
                    <sup>2</sup> “The Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of a king who prepared a great wedding feast for his son. 
                    <sup>3</sup> When the banquet was ready, he sent his servants to notify those who were invited. But they all refused to come!

                    <sup>8</sup> And he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, and the guests I invited aren’t worthy of the honor. 
                    <sup>9</sup> Now go out to the street corners and invite everyone you see.’ 
                    <sup>10</sup> So the servants brought in everyone they could find, good and bad alike, and the banquet hall was filled with guests. 
                    <sup>11</sup>  “But when the king came in to meet the guests, he noticed a man who wasn’t wearing the proper clothes for a wedding. 
                    <sup>12</sup> ‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how is it that you are here without wedding clothes?’ But the man had no reply. 
                    <sup>13</sup> Then the king said to his aides, ‘Bind his hands and feet and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

                <p> 
                    <sup>15</sup>  Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
                    <sup>16</sup> For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. 
                    <sup>17</sup> And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.

                    <sup>13</sup> That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, 
                    <sup>14</sup> and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. 
                    <sup>15</sup> While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. 
                    <sup>16</sup> But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. 
                    <sup>17</sup> And he said to them, “What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?” And they stood still, looking sad. 
                    <sup>18</sup> Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” 
                    <sup>19</sup> And he said to them, “What things?” And they said to him, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, 
                    <sup>20</sup> and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 
                    <sup>21</sup> But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. 
                    <sup>22</sup> Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, 
                    <sup>23</sup> and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. 
                    <sup>24</sup> Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.” 
                    <sup>25</sup> And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!

                        <sup>22</sup>  He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem. 
                        <sup>23</sup> And someone said to him, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” And he said to them, 
                        <sup>24</sup> “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able. 
                        <sup>25</sup> When once the master of the house has risen and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' then he will answer you, 'I do not know where you come from.' 
                        <sup>26</sup> Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.' 
                        <sup>27</sup> But he will say, 'I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of evil!' 
                        <sup>28</sup> In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves cast out. 
                        <sup>29</sup> And people will come from east and west, and from north and south, and recline at table in the kingdom of God. 
                        <sup>30</sup> And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”
